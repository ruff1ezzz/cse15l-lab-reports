**Lab 3:**

## 0) Pair Programming

In **Lab 3**, first, I watched an informational video on pair programming.

## 1) Getting Started

Then, I had to watch another video on how the a programmer incrementally coded the MarkDown parsing implementation.

Afterwards, I answered questions on about the video, such as:
* How many times did the programmer use the internet to look up how to do something?
* Around what was the largest number of lines of code written in between runs of the program?
* Around how many times did the programmer use autocomplete on a variable name? How many typos do you think this helped avoid?

## 2) Getting and Running the Code

Furthermore, I was prompted to fork, which is a complete copy of the repository that sits in your account, a given repository, which contained two files:

* MarkdownParse.java
* test-file.md

Repository to fork - [link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser)

After forking/cloing the repository, I made sure I can run it by using the commands form the video:

* `javac MarkdownParse.java`
* `java MarkdownParse test-file.md`
