**Lab 1:**

In **Lab 1**, first I met my lab group and introduced each other. Then I was prompted to download VS Code, which I already did. And then we worked on remotely connecting to  our ieng6 accounts server by inputing `$ ssh cs15lsp22ajc@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into the terminal and got the result of:

```

```

I couldn't find a screenshot prior to adding the keygen but if I were to run the `$ ssh cs15lsp22ajc@ieng6.ucsd.edu` without the keygen, the terminal would ask me for my server account password and run similarly to the screenshot provided.

Afterwards, I worked on running commands, such as 

* `ls`
* `cd` 
* `ls -t` 
* `ls -la` 
* `dir`
* `pwd` 

in the ieng6 server:

Then, I learned how to move files from my computer to the ieng6 server using the scp command, scp WhereAmI.java cs15lsp22ajc@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/. In the image below it is the aftermath of transferring the WhereAmI.java file from my computer to the ieng6 server:

Finally, I learned how to create a ssh keygen to log into my ieng6 server account faster and more efficiently without typing my long password. For this I had to input some ssh-keygen command and create a keygen for my account and below in the image you can see that after creating the keygen I didn't have to input my password anymore:

**Lab 2:**

In **Lab 2**, I worked on creating a new GitHub account. First, I created a new account, then I created a new repository in my account to start a new project. Then I was able to write something on the file. Then I went to settings --> page and link it to the main branch, which then gave me the access to the link of my md file website.
