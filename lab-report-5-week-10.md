**Lab 9:**

## 1) Using a Script to Run Many Files

Firstly, at the start of this lab, my labmate and I had to clone a given repository of a new MarkDownParse repository and ran `time bash script.sh` to see how long it took to run the bash script for a total of 652 test files.

The result:
![timebash](imgLR5/timebash.png)

Then we edited the `script.sh` file by adding `echo $file` under the `java MarkdownParse $file`. This prints out the names of the test files after every result is printed.

We then use the copied the results into a new text file called `reuslts.txt` by using the command `bash script.sh > results.txt`. This command takes all the texts that `bash script.sh` prints and copy it into a new file `results.txt`.

Then, I cloned my version of MarkdownParse into my ssh ieng6 server too and copied the `text-files` directory and `script.sh` file into my cloned MarkdownParse repository from the given repository. I used these command to do that: "`cp -r cse15lsp22-markdown-parser/test-files my-markdown-parser/`" and "`cp cse15lsp22-markdown-parser/script.sh my-markdown-parser/`"

Finally, I followed the same steps of creating a new `result.txt` file and copying the results of my version of `markdownparse`.

## 2) Comparing Two Implementations

Now that we have 2 different `results.txt` file, one in my cloned MarkDownParse repository and another in the given repository, we can compare it using `vimdiff`.

First, I went back into my home directory by running `cd ~` command and then running `$ vimdiff my-markdown-parser/results.txt cse15lsp22-markdown-parser/results.txt` command.

After running the command this is what I got:

I just scroll through manually to spot the differences in the results.

Here is the link of the first test-file with different results:
[Different result](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/573.md)

![foo ![bar](/url)](/url2)

The above "foo bar" doesn't work because it's an invalid link so the expected output should be just `[]`. Below is the output of `573.md` for both `my-markdown-parser` and the `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser`:

![573](imgLR5/573.png)

On the left it shows the result of `my-markdown-parser` and the right shows the result of `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser`.

Based on the test results, my implementation of markdown parser is correct because the result is an empty list. The syntax `![foo ![bar](/url)](/url2)` has many errors and especially since the format of how the link is written includes an `!` at the very beginning, it is the syntax of writing an image link, therefore the url is invalid and it shouldn't be added to the list. 

This wrong output error in `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser` is occuring because in the `MarkdownParse.java` file in that repository, the `MarkdownParse` method doesn't check if an exclamation mark makes a link valid or not. Therefore the result of that `MarkdownParse` method will still include the link of an image in the list.

In the image above, the code in the upper part is from my `MarkdownParse.java` file and the code in the terminal is from `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser` repository. All you need is to add code from line 21 to 25 from my `MarkdownParse.java` into the `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser` repository's `MarkdownParse` method.

Here is the link of the second test-file with different results:
[Different result](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/573.md)

![foo](train.jpg)

The above error is similar to the first test-file. The text in this `577.md` file is written in the syntax for image link. Below is the output of `573.md` for both `my-markdown-parser` and the `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser`:

![577](imgLR5/577.png)

On the left it shows the result of `my-markdown-parser` and the right shows the result of `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser`.

Based on the test results, my implementation of `MarkdownParse` is correct because the result of my `MarkdownParse` is an empty list. The syntax `![577](imgLR5/577.png)` doesn't have any errors in its own form of syntax but the format of how the link is written includes an `!` at the very beginning which turns it into an image link, therefore the url is invalid and it shouldn't be added to the list. 

Just like the `573.md` test file, this wrong output error in `cse15lsp22-markdown-parser` is occuring because in the `MarkdownParse.java` file in that repository, the `MarkdownParse` method doesn't check if an exclamation mark makes a link valid or not. Therefore the result of that `MarkdownParse` method will still include the link of an image in the list.

![excl](imgLR5/excl.png)

You can just add the code from line 21 to 25 and paste it in the code in the terminal right after the while loop, so that the `markdownparse` method can instantly break when it detects an `!` in the test-file.
