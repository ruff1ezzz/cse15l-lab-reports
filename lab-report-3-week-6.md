**Lab 5:**

## 1) Synchronize Your Group Work

Before we start the lab, we updated our repositories with the latest and most efficient `markdownparse` method.

## 2) Setup Github Actions on a Repository
Then we set up **Github Actions** on my `MarkdownParse` repository. 

>**Github action** - One of the greatest tools available for >continuous integration.
>
>- Other common tools: Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, Buddy, Travis Cl.

First, I clicked on `Actions` on my github repository. Then, I select `set up a workflow yourself`. Then, I named the file: `main.yml`.

In the yml file, I deleted some unnecessary lines and added the following code in the `run` area. Below is my input:

![ymlsetup](imagesLabReport3/yml.png)

This would then give me the access to running my tests in Github Action. I first created a failed test in my `MarkdownParseTest.java` file to check Github Action response to a failed test. Below is the result when I commited and pushed to the main repository:

![ymlsetup](imagesLabReport3/GithubActionError.png)

The above error is occuring because I needed to delete all the `.jar` files from `gitIgnore`. After doing so I got another error:

![ymlsetup](imagesLabReport3/GithubActionAnotherError.png)

This error was rather simple to fix because it was just that I used the full file path like: `/Users/aungbong/Documents/GitHub/markdown-parser/testFiles/...` as input files in my `MarkdownParseTest.java` file. After fixing it I got:

![ymlsetup](imagesLabReport3/GithubActionFix.png)

Afterwards, I commited and pushed to my main repository.

## 3) Improve markdown-parse

In this step, I had to improve our `Markdown-parse`, and use Github Action to test and fix a new failure inducing file.

First, I created a failure inducing file:
[Failure Inducing file](https://github.com/ruff1ezzz/markdown-parser/runs/6236776143?check_suite_focus=true)

Then, my partner and I tried to improve our `MarkDownParse` method and got a fix:
[Fix to issue](https://github.com/ruff1ezzz/markdown-parser/runs/6236814069?check_suite_focus=true)

## 4) Streamline ssh Configuration

Usually, when I log into my ieng6 accoutn form my laptop, I have to type a long line of `$ ssh cs15lsp22ajc@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. But there is a way to access the account without typing this long line everytime you want to access it.

* First, I have to access my `.ssh` directory. 
* In order to access it, in the terminal, I first typed `$ cd ~` which would lead me to my houme directory. 
* Once I am in my home directory, I typed `$ ls -a` to find any `.ssh` directory is one of the hidden directories.
* Then I typed `$ cd .ssh` which leads me inside the `.ssh` directory.
* Afterwards, I added a `config` file in the directory.
* Finally I added the following code:

>Host ieng6
>
>____HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
>
>____User cs15lsp22ajc

After all the above step, I cleared my terminal and tried logging into my ieng6 account again. But this time just simply typing: `$ ssh ieng6` and got logged in instantly.

## 5) Set up Github Access from ieng6

## 6) Copy Whole Directories with scp -r
